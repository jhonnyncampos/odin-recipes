        <img src="../images/Lasagna.jpeg">
        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish made with layers of wide, 
            flat pasta noodles interspersed with a mixture of meat and vegetables, 
            and covered with a <em>rich</em> tomato or cream sauce and melted cheese.</p>

            <p>The dish is typically baked in the oven, allowing the flavors to meld 
            and the cheese to become golden and bubbly. 
            Lasagna is typically served as a hearty main course, 
            and can be paired with a salad or other side dishes for a complete meal.</p>

                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large saucepan, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic
                over medium heat until the beef is browned. Drain off
                any excess fat.</li>

                <li>Stir in the <b>diced tomatoes</b>, <b>tomato paste</b>, <b>tomato sauce</b>,
                <b>parsley</b>, <b>salt</b>, <b>black pepper</b>, <b>basil</b>, <b>oregano</b>, 
                and <b>sugar</b>. <em>Simmer</em> for at least 1 hour,
                stirring occasionally.
                </li>

                <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook the lasagna noodles in the boiling water for <em>8 to 10</em>
                minutes, or until <em>al dente</em>. Drain the noodles, and rinse
                them under cold water.</li>

                <li>In a small bowl, mix the ricotta cheese and egg together.</li>

                <li>Preheat the oven to <b>375 degrees F</b>.</li>

                <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a small amount of the meat
                sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange
                4 noodles over the sauce. Spread half of the ricotta cheese
                mixture over the noodles, and sprinkle with half of the parmesean
                cheese. Top with a third of the remaining meat sauce, and 
                half of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, ending 
                with a layer of noodles and the remaining meat sauce.
                Sprinkle the top with the remaining mozzarella.</li>

                <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>

                <li>Bake in the oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil, and
                bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the top is lightly
                browned and the lasagna is heated through. Let stand
                for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
